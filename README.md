Create challenges, set questions, **engage** users and measure results.

## Idea
This app was developed on the Hackathon event that was organized by Pošta Slovenije(https://postartup.si/sprint-poste-slovenije-2020/). Our team developed the app and the CMS for organizations that want to encourage employees to learn about important new company-relevant knowledge. In our app, we added gamification elements to make learning and usage of our app more interesting and fun. 

**The app is a prototype of an idea. We made it in less than 24 hours, so code is not perfect.**

**With this idea, we came in 2nd place.**
